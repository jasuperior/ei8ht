-   [x] finish implementing `fromKey`
-   [ ] abstract unit types into classes (memory efficiency)
-   [x] allow units to accept primitive children
-   [ ] look at the timing of asyncUnit.next resolution (catch in particular)
-   [ ] should asyncUnits be cancellable
-   [ ] async unit rejection strategy
-   [ ] implement Iterator interface on units
-   [ ] define JSX Intrinsics
-   [ ] handle errors
-   [ ] create HTML helper unit
-   [ ] rework unit model to implicitly make the Parent into a unit scope

-   [ ] implement fromKey as a promise or iterator of the eventual value?
